<h1>Hi! I'm crystal :)</h2>
<p>Here's a website about myself, not much, but I'm quite satisfied with this.</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>Since this is the first time I'm building a website, I decided to work with and learn static/basic html, css and javascript. <br>All music/art/UI is done by me :P</p>
<p>This was coded on Github Codespaces on iPad, since I don't have a computer (quite surprised I could finish this)</p>
<h3>Features</h3>

<p>TAKE NOTE: All interactive features are tested on the iPad solely, hopefully they work on desktop/computer too T_T</p>

<p>Thank you for viewing this page :D</p>

<p><b>Thanks,</b><p>
